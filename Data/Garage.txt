Looking around the garage you see your two cars. Your number 95 car and your teammates 86 car. On the wall near your car you see a locked safe. Moving all around the garage are different personal of the team. You see the different mechanics preparing for the race, your teammate standing over by his car and the Team Principle (your boss) looking at a bunch of computers. Close to your car you see your engineer.
